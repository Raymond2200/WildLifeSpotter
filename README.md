## Description:
Moose Tracks is about empowering users across the continent whether in remote communities, on the road, near a campsite, or in a regular suburban neighborhood. Moose tracks enables itâ€™s users to view sightings of potentially hazardous or inconvenient wildlife in there area. This allows users to plan and react accordingly. To add a spot a user simply needs to create an account with us and by adding a spot they can alert users in their local area of the animals approximate location. Spots do timeout so there is no need to worry about removing your old spots.
